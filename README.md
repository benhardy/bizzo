## Various businessy utility libraries for Java.

This is experimental and not even alpha. Basically there's no good reason to use this yet.

Oh, you're still reading. Hi and welcome. This is an experiment partly in APIs in a very small domain, shortly to be joined by other small domains with the intention of being insanely loosely coupled.

It's also an experiment in integrating useful CI processes such as SONAR and CodeCov, and I hope to try that out on other languages. I think it's important to get useful feedback right on the PR where you work.

It also doesn't work yet so don't let the pretty tests fool you.
